# DPA11 - Trials and Tribulations of Building an App with React/Redux

React is a view library only

## React Definitions 
- Declarative - look like this, instead of do this
    - UI Updates
- Components - Reusable views
Props - properties passed into component 
    - You could pass many things in as props
State - How things are (changeable)    

## Data
- Redux is the data layer that provides state for the entire app
- So things you need to access across multiple components would go into Redux

## Planning your React App
